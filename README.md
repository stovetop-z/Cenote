# Cenote
## Overview
A Comma-Separated File (*CSV*) file reader written in C++. My attempt to create a pandas copy-cat. This, like *Pandas*, converts a *CSV* file to a **dataframe**. The idea is to make the library light weight and quick. 

## Special Features
I love working with *Pandas* due to its diverse capabilities. However, as an aspiring data scientist, there are certain aspects of the data manipulation/exploring process that were more streamlined and intuitive. *Cenote* uses easy terms and makes assumptions that mitigate errors when working with data; while still offering the flexibility of being precise. This is a work in progress, but here are some features I hope to add:
- Merge two *Cenote* dataframes
- Delete duplicates - **DONE**
- Check for **null** values
- Perform vector and matrix operations where applicable
- Convert data to an *SQL* database
- Read *SQL* database in as a dataframe
- Make *SQL* like commands for easy command line access to files
- Add columns and rows

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to my wife for supporting me in this project. All the tears, tantrums, and toddling-terros that berate her from our two-year old while I strive to build a career for our family to provide a good life have made her all the more glorious in my eyes; and I am forever indebted to her.
